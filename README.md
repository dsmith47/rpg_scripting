# RPG Software

A place to dump various projects/ideas/scripts that I end up using for RPG
purposes. Most are simple and *very* specific, but they're all worth having
versioning and remote storage.

### Calendar Scripting

I wanted to do a multi-moon planetary model, but I also wanted their phases
to line up in cool ways.
